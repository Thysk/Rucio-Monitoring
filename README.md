# Rucio - Monitoring


A collection of helm-charts to deploy monitoring solutions for Rucio.
This includes the documentation for each of the deployment methods, and dashboards for some initial monitoring dashboards.

The intention of this repo is to allow people to configure and setup monitoring for their own Rucio instances, and when they have developed new dashboards and visualsations that they think could be useful to other communities contribute back.

Current contents include:

- Helm charts to deploy OpenSearch, the instructions to connect the components, and the dashboard to deploy on grafana to visualise the data from Rucio.
- Helm charts to deploy ElasticSearch, the instructions to connect the components, and the dashboard to deploy on grafana to visualise the data from Rucio.
